# Musings on coffee (mostly espresso)

This page will take about espresso machines, grinders for espresso and
the general preparation of espresso and its drinks.

## Current gear

* Mazzer Mini-E Type A
* ECM Synchronika

## Previous gear

* Baratza Preciso
* Baratza Vario
* Rancilio Silvia V2

## Baratza Preciso

We bought the Silvia and the Preciso as a combo from Seattle Coffee
Gear.  Overall the buying experience was painless but I don't believe
the Preciso is a good enough entry level grinder for espresso.
In our experience, the grind was too distrubuted which created a lot
of channeling.
Seattle Coffee Gear was not able to help much except by returning the
grinder and the espresso machine and I decided to call Baratza.
Baratza said the Vario was a better choice and for a bit more extra
money they could get me the Vario if I returned the Preciso.
We didn't think twice and the Vario arrived a few days later.

## Baratza Vario

This was our first entry level burr grinder.  It lasted 3 years and it
was paired with a Silvia V2.  The grind distribution was much better
than the Preciso and it was the first time I was happy about our 18g
3rd wave coffee espressi.  The Vario was pretty much our learning tool
about espresso grinders.
Two of the most notable problems with this grinder were the dials and
the internal mess.  Over time, the dials decided to move on their own
and we had to hold them all the time when we were griding.  The second
problem was how messy the internals would get after a few months.  For
some reason the ground beans sometimes would leak inside the case and
over time they would accumulate.
