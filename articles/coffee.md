## Baratza Preciso

We bought the Silvia and the Preciso as a combo from Seattle Coffee
Gear.  Overall the buying experience was painless but I don't believe
the preciso is a good enough entry level grinder for espresso.
In our experience, the grind was too distrubuted which created a lot
of channeling.
Seattle Coffee Gear was not able to help much except by returning the
grinder and the espresso machine and I decided to call Baratza.
Baratza said the Vario was a better choice and for a bit more extra
money they could get me the Vario if I returned the Preciso.
We didn't think twice and the Vario arrived a few days later.

## Baratza Vario

This was our first entry level burr grinder.  It lasted 3 years and it
was paired with a Silvia V2.
